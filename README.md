# Matt-s-Bandcamp-Shortcode-Thing

You want to use the Bandcamp shortcode but it's for WordPress.com and you are running WordPress.org. Oh no, it doesn't work. What now? This plugin (should subject to testing) fixes all that.

TL;DR: The Bandcamp shortcode will work now.

## How to use

1. Download the PHP file
2. Upload to your plugins folder
3. Go to plugins on your WordPress admin area and enable it
4. That's it. The shortcode now works.

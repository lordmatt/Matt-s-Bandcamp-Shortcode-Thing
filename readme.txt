Enables use of the Bandcamp WordPress shortcode.

== Description ==

You want to embed a Bandcamp song but, "oh no" the shortcode only works on WordPress.com. Not to worry. This plugin lets you use the shortcode on your blog too.

I was annoyed that I could not use the Bandcamp shortcode so I wrote a very simple plugin to let me do that. It does not do anything else.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How does it work? =
Paste the shortcode in a paragraph by itself (in say, the shortcode block). It will ensure you get the right iframe html to show the song.

= What settings are there? =

None. Just use the shortcode they give you.
